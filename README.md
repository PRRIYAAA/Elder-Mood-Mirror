## 💡 **About the Project**

Elder Mood Mirror (EMMA) is an AI-powered web platform created to enhance the emotional and mental well-being of senior citizens. It combines real-time mood detection through camera-based facial emotion analysis with daily wellness surveys to help elders track their emotional health and receive timely support.

As people age, emotional challenges like loneliness, anxiety, and mild depression often go unnoticed, especially when families live apart or elders have limited social interaction. While family care remains central to emotional well-being, it can be difficult for loved ones to consistently monitor subtle mood changes amidst daily responsibilities.

EMMA is designed not to replace family support, but to strengthen it. By offering continuous emotional monitoring, automatic alerts, and communication channels between doctors and guardians, EMMA ensures that families stay informed, connected, and responsive to their elder’s mental state.

Through AI-driven insights and shared visibility across caregivers, doctors, and family members, EMMA empowers a collaborative ecosystem of care  promoting early intervention, emotional stability, and a sense of belonging for elders
